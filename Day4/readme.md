## BABEL

- if the browser is very old than it will not understand ES6 or anything than Babel actually converts the code , it is a node package , it is an another piece of JS code and it will convert it to another form that is older version of JS so that the older versions of browsers can also suppport
- Parcel doesnot remove consoles
- How does the createElement works? it is an object having id , keys , props

```
$$typeof:Symbol(react.element)
key:"h2"
props:{children: 'heading 2 from sadfsf'}
ref:null
type:"h2"
_owner:null_store:
{validated: false}
```

- To reduce the pain of createelement we use JSX it is Javascript XML (though it was not mentioned anywhere) when FB cretaed react that we want to create 
- Is JSX html inside JS? NO --> why ? it is html like syntax but its not html it is HTML like syntax or a syntactical sugar for createElement
- Babel creates Abstract syntax tree 02
