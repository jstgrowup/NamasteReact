# Microservices
- when we are building a big project only one CRA is not possible 
- UBER has 100s of microservices 
- Microservice architecture 
- earlier there use to be  a single big application it was also known as Monolith architecture
- But now the world is moving towards microservices
- for example UI. Backend,notifications,logs, authentication etc everything will be services 
- every microservices dont have to worry about anything other microservice 
# useEffect
- we call this function with a callback function not immediately but whenever the useeffect wants it to be called 
- Its a hook
