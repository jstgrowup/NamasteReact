- if the browser is really old than this polyfill will converet the new form of code to an older form of code
- polyfill is converting one form of code to an other form of code 
- babel does this work
- createElement is pain so we will use JSX
- JSX is known as javascript XML
- the react want to write the html in our JS file
- is JSX html inside JS --> this is not right html inside JS this is HTML like syntax (syntactic sugar) it is not at all HTML inside JS
- How does jsx is doing this ? this is done by the babel so here babel is doing this means the conversion of the Html like syntax to the HTML DOM
- JSX ==>(babel) React.createElement ==> Object ==>(reactDOM) HTML(DOM)
- Readibility, usability
