- react
- hooks are just functions
- usestate returns an array and the first element is the variable and the second variable is the updater function

## Named export

- Multiple values or functions can be exported from a module using named exports.
- Each export is given a name, and you use those names when importing in other files

## Default exports

- A module can have only one default export.
- The exported value or function doesn't need to have a name, and it can be assigned any name during import.

## Hooks

- React Hooks provide a more concise and expressive way to work with state and side effects in functional components, making it easier to understand and maintain React code.
