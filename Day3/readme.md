## Igniting the react app

- webpack is a bundler , parcel and vite etc these are bundlers
- bundler is responsible for a lot of superpowers
- we will use parcel
- in CRA we use webpack , so CRA uses webpack and babel
- npm does not stands for node package manager (there is no official name for npm)
- npm is used to manage our packages
- why we use npm (because we need more packages in our react app)
- why npm i -D parcel (means install as dev dependencies) dependency means all the packages my project needs
  we need parcel in development mode
- ^(tilda) and ~ () (so that the packages will be auto updated)
- package-lock.json why ? it will exaclty tell us the version we are using and some extra information , it locks the version , package lock.json it locks the version and never put it in gitignore
- nodemodules should be in gitignore because our package-lock.json and package.json has all the information about all our packages
