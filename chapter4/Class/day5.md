- JSX can only have one parent if you dont want a div than you can use React.Fragment

```
<React.Fragment>
it is an empty tag
</React.Fragment>
```
to reduce the effort of writting this long line we can use <></> aka react.fragment its a JSX and behind the scene it is React.fragment. 
- Config driven UI (an API that is different for different configurations)
- React Consiliation its an dif algorithm one tree from another and finds out what needs to be updated and it just rerenders 
- React DOM
